# INSTALL
PowerShell scripting for Microsoft Dynamics CRM

As a first requirement, I assume that you are a .NET developer 
and that you have a Visual Studio development environment at disposal. 
You should be fine using a Windows 7 SP1 or a Windows 2008 SP1 operating 
system or higher. For information, the following examples uses 
Visual Studio 2012 Professional edition, on a Windows 8 Professional desktop.

Software requirements
---------------------

  - Windows .NET Framework 4.0
  
    Windows .NET Framework 4.0 is available here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17851

  - Windows Management Framework 4.0
  
    Windows Management Framework 4.0 is available here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855

    The Windows Management Framework will install PowerShell 4.0 
    on the computer if necessary. This update includes types required 
    to create custom PowerShell commands. 
    
  - Windows Identity Foundation 3.5
  
    Windows Identity Foundation 3.5 is available here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17331
    
    The Windows Identity Foundation is a must have while developing 
    for Dynamics CRM platform. It provides, among others features, 
    pre-built security logic in order to connect to Dynamics CRM 
    organizations implementing claims-based authentication.

Set-up the IDE environment
--------------------------

  - PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)
  
    Windows PowerShell ISE is a graphic integrated development 
    environment (IDE) edited by Microsoft. This IDE allows developers 
    to write and run commands and debug scripts.
    
    On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, PowerShell Integrated Scripting 
    Environment (ISE) is installed and enabled. 
    
    On Windows 2008 R2, PowerShell ISE is not enabled by default. 
    You can useâ€¦ PowerShell (!) as Administrator in order to 
    activate this feature:
    
    Import-Module ServerManager Add-Windowsfeature PowerShell-ISE

    On Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 SP1, PowerShell ISE must be 
    installed through the Windows Management Framework.
    
  - You can use NuGet in order to manage the required CRM SDK libraries 
    needed in this project. NuGet is a Visual Studio extension which provide 
    an easier way to manage .NET projects dependencies. 
    The NuGet documentation is available here: http://docs.nuget.org/


  - Unlock restricted execution Policies
    In order to enforce security, PowerShell scripts executions are blocked 
    by default. This policy is relevant since PowerShell main purpose is 
    to provide administrative features.
  
    You will want to unblock PowerShell scripts execution through command line 
    as Administrator. For example:
  
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
